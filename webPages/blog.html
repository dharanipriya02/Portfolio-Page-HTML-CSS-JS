			    <h5>How technology has affected our daily lives, May 17, 2018</h5><br>
			    <p>In the recent world, technology is developing at a very fast pace and people from different fields of the world are being benefited  with  the advancement of technology. Our everyday work is being very easy and comfortable.  It is really hard to imagine our life without technology. Technology has come into play in every sector of our life. Sometimes I wonder how our ancestors lived with no any gadgets and electronic devices.
Technology is enabling us to make communication with our relatives and loved ones and to strengthen our relations with our friends, workmates, etc. Communication is one of the most important factor in our lives. Every day we make many phone calls, text messages and email. We submit our coursework by sitting inside a room in front of our laptop screen. We can know whatâ€™s going on the other place in less than seconds. A universe has became a village due to the advancement of the technology. There were times when a letter took more than a month to reach its destined place but those days are only imaginable now.<br><br>

Social media is helping us a lot in this regard. Technology has done miracles in bringing much ease and comfort for student all around the world. They can study online while remaining at their home in any part of the world. They can learn any course and get a degree of the desired university online. 
Even when I get sick and go to the hospital, the technology there has not left to surprise me. The condition of our health is diagnosed in a better way. We can get to look what is happening in the internal body parts and what can be done to improve our health. Just imagine us not being able to scan our internal body parts. The life expectancy of people would decrease and we could not know what was the actual cause of the death. Better health facilities are being provided now to patients and research done by doctors has  made easier control diseases.<br><br>

 Travelling is also becoming more easier through technology . We can gain knowledge of all nation just in a click. Its been easy to understand the place that people want to visit. Not only that now people can online book hotels . Whenever I plan to go out with my mates, family or relatives, the first thing I do is look the place in the internet and research everything including climate, lifestyle, and history of that place. The internet let us look into the things which were considered to be very difficult without the internet. And the second thing I do is book the hotels, reserve the flights tickets and head on. <br><br>

Seriously,  the technology has given us much more than we could have ever imagined. For me, my life would be a hell without the use of the technology. The world has taken a turn due to the advancements in technology. For me, my everyday life would be unimaginable if there were no technology. Although there are some of drawbacks of the modern technology but its advantage has taken over.<br>
